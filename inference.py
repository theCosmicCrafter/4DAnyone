    """Generate synchronized target-view videos from one monocular video.

    Args:
        video_path: Input video; it must contain at least 121 usable frames.
        views_per_layer: Number of evenly spaced yaw views at each pitch. It
            must be divisible by 4 or 6.
        layer_pitches: Camera pitch for each layer in degrees, for example
            [-10,15,35]. Positive values place the camera above the subject;
            each value must be between -15 and 45.
        start_yaw: First yaw in every layer, in degrees; 0 faces the person.
        yaw_span: Angular range sampled by each layer, from 1 to 360 degrees.
            The end angle is excluded so a full ring never duplicates a view.
        views_per_group: Maximum target views generated together. auto chooses
            6 when possible and otherwise 4; a manual value must be 4 or 6 and
            divide views_per_layer.
        vram_mode: VRAM management profile ('auto', 'low', 'medium', 'high').
            'low' forces group size 2 and proactive 3D VAE spatial tiling (<16GB VRAM).
            'medium' uses group size 3 and tiled VAE (24GB VRAM).
            'high' uses un-tiled VAE and group size 6 (32GB+ VRAM).
        enable_rcp: Use proposal views before generating more than six targets.
            The proposal count follows views_per_group.
        enable_tcr: Shift view groups between denoising steps. Partial yaw
            ranges remain open sequences rather than wrapping their endpoints.
        data_dir: Root for reusable GVHMR motion and final 4DAnyone outputs.
        model_dir: Model root; missing public checkpoints download here.
        checkpoint_path: Local 4DAnyone checkpoint override.
        mhr70_regressor_path: Local SMPL-X-to-MHR70 regressor override.
        gvhmr_root: Path to the GVHMR source checkout.
        device: CUDA device, for example cuda:0.
        target_fps: auto preserves the input clock unless it divides evenly
            to 24, 25, or 30 FPS; a positive number requests an explicit FPS.
        start_time: Clip start time on the input timeline, in seconds.
        seed: Random seed shared by proposal and target generation.
        run_name: Optional custom output directory name. If None, auto-generates
            a dynamic, collision-free name like <clip>_<N>views_s<seed>.
